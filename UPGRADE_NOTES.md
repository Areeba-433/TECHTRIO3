## DB Changes

#### New column in MFA Option table

In PR [#4115](https://github.com/eclipse/kapua/pull/4115) a new `has_trust_me` column has been added to the `atht_mfa_option`.

New column defaults to `null` and doesn't need any migration. The code itself will populate the column accordingly on first update.
For large `atht_mfa_option` tables it might take sometime to be added.
